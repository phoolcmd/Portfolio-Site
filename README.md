# Portfolio-Site
This is a personal portfolio site that is still a work in progress. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills, projects, and music, while also providing a platform to learn and practice Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
# Demoing the Site
If you would like to demo the site without building it yourself, you can visit the project's Github Pages by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the Environments section on the right-hand side of the repository page.
2. Click on the Github Pages link.
3. Open the latest deployment to view the live site.
